# Weather-App
My first project where I feel it is worth to be on gitHub. Did everything myself with no tutorials just a little bit of stack overflow. I left comments on every function for easier readabilty. Icons cretaed by Charlotte de Wolfe.

Project is built using HTML, SCSS and ES6 JS.

Let me know what you think!
